# SocialSphere_Java
The goal of this project is to helped me learn and apply core Java EE concepts using Servlets, JSP, and JDBC to build a basic social media platform. This platform will allow users  to register, log in, create posts, view others’ posts, and comment on them - mimicking a  minimal version of Facebook's functionality.
